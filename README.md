# Set Subdivs
 This was originally written by me around July of 2022 but only I've decided to make it public as of now(January 2024)  
 It's A very simple script that will automatically set the number of Arnold subdivisions relative to the subdivisions on one reference object based on bounding box size. 
 
**Example**

Here my reference geometry is my biggest model, the torus set to have 5 subdivisions. You can see it's automatically given the cone object 2 subdivision iterations since it's much smaller.
