# Set Subdivs
 This was originally written by me around July of 2022 but only I've decided to make it public as of now(January 2024)  
 It's A very simple script that will automatically set the number of Arnold subdivisions relative to the subdivisions on one reference object based on bounding box size. 
**Example**
In the Scene below I've set my biggest object (the torus) to have 5 subdivisions. You can see it's automatically given the smaller cone object 2 subdivision iterations.
